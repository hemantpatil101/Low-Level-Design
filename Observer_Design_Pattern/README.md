## Observer Design Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object (Observable / Subject) maintains a list of dependents (Observers) that are notified of state changes.
## When to Use
- When multiple objects need to be updated when one object changes.

- When you want to implement an event-driven system.

- When you want to decouple the subject from its observers.
