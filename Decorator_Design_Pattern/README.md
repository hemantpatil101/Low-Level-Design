## Decorator Design Pattern

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to dynamically add behavior to an object without modifying its original class.

## When to Use

- When you want to extend functionalities dynamically without changing the existing code.

- When you need flexibility in modifying behavior at runtime.

- When inheritance is not feasible due to the explosion of subclasses.
