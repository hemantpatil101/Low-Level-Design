## Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a class's behavior to be selected at runtime. It helps define a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

## When to Use

- When you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to switch between them dynamically.

- When you want to avoid using too many if-else or switch statements.

- When you want to keep algorithms independent of the client code.
