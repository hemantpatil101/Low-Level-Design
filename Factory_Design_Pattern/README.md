## Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class that will be instantiated. It encapsulates object creation logic, making the system more maintainable and scalable.

## When to Use Factory Pattern?
 - Encapsulation of Object Creation → Hides complex logic and dependencies.
 - Decoupling of Code → The client code does not need to know the exact class name.
 - Code Flexibility → Easy to add new object types without modifying existing code.
 - Switching Implementations Dynamically → Helps choose object creation at runtime.
